# Contributing to App Store Icon Hunter

We love your input! We want to make contributing to App Store Icon Hunter as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/Garyku0/app-store-icon-hunter/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/username/app-store-icon-hunter/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Virtual environment tool (venv, conda, etc.)

### Setup Steps

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Garyku0/app-store-icon-hunter.git
cd app-store-icon-hunter

# 2. Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 4. Install pre-commit hooks (if available)
pre-commit install

# 5. Run tests to ensure everything works
pytest
```

### Development Dependencies

The development dependencies include:
- `pytest` - Testing framework
- `pytest-cov` - Coverage reporting
- `black` - Code formatting
- `flake8` - Linting
- `mypy` - Type checking

## Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

### Formatting
```bash
# Format all code
black app_store_icon_hunter/
black tests/
```

### Linting
```bash
# Check code style
flake8 app_store_icon_hunter/
flake8 tests/
```

### Type Checking
```bash
# Run type checker
mypy app_store_icon_hunter/
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app_store_icon_hunter

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_cli.py

# Run tests matching a pattern
pytest -k "test_search"
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Add integration tests for CLI commands
- Mock external API calls in tests

Example test structure:
```python
def test_search_functionality():
    """Test that search returns expected results."""
    # Arrange
    search_term = "test app"
    
    # Act
    results = search_apps(search_term)
    
    # Assert
    assert len(results) > 0
    assert all('name' in app for app in results)
```
